INTRO

Think back to unit one, when we were making static frontends. Sometimes you'd need a function to run once the page loaded, and we used a specific event listener for that. useEffect accomplishes the same thing, essentially, but with more degree of control available, because we can set it up to perform a specific bit of logic based off a number of different triggers.

Understanding why it's set up this way is a bit easier if you have at least a passing familiarity with the lifecycle methods that are part of class components. 

SETUP

We're doing npx/npm, fuck yarn
Going to walk them through hitting the backend with useEffect before setting them loose
MAKE SURE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEEDBACK LOOP OF SETTING STATE WITHIN USEEFFECT


Lead them through goal one, touch base with them, see if they're feeling up to trying goal 2 on their own
